# Next Level JavaScript Course Project: Nintendo Console and Games E-shop

-This project is an online store that offers Nintendo consoles and games, both new and retro. 
-The development has been done using HTML, Tailwind CSS, with a touch of custom CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Seamless Cross-Device Experience
-Access the site from a computer, tablet, or mobile for a consistent browsing experience. 
-On desktop, the cart sidebar opens automatically when you move to the right, and there's also an accessibility button.
  
### Catalog
-Add items from various sections, including search results, category sliders, or filtered items below.
-The cart includes partial total, total items, and options to remove individual items or clear the entire cart.

### User Accounts with Local Storage
-Register and create an account, and user data is stored in local storage, just like cart contents.

### Search
-Utilize a database array for the search functionality across all pages (dataBase). It provides partial results beneath the input, including the item and its price, and it's case-sensitive. We recommend using keywords like "Mario," "Zelda," or "Joystick."

### JS Implemented Features

-Automatic image and card sliders for a dynamic browsing experience.
-Real-time search functionality with partial results and dynamic drawing.
-Cart navigation and scrolling actions.
-Actions on cart, login, and sign-in icons.
-Buttons to add items to the cart from any part of the web app.
-Full cart functionality, including buy, clear, and hide.
-Real-time cart updates after clicking "Add to Cart."
-"X" button to individually remove items from the cart.
-Function to calculate the cart total using forEach loop for individual items and the overall total.
-Real-time updating of the total value in HTML when adding, removing, or clearing items.
-Restoring stock when removing an item, whether by clearing the cart or individually removing by index.
-Real-time search with partial results below the input, displaying item name and price.
-On desktop, the cart slides in when moving the mouse within 2% of the right margin and hides when the mouse is outside the cart. On mobile, tap within 5% to open the cart -or use the nav button.
-Functional login with welcome or error alerts for data import.
-Real-time item filtering by type with the option to purchase directly.
-Storage of account creation data and cart content in local storage.

-Drawing search results in divs, adapting a specific div for that purpose with individual size modification.
-Aesthetic use of the Alerts library.
